My dad has a small goat farm with two female goats and one male goat. A while ago, one of the goats gave birth, but sadly, the baby goat died because its head got stuck in a wooden plank during the night. Nobody noticed, so we found it already dead the next morning.

To prevent something like this from happening again, I want to create a system that can detect and alert us if a goat cries out loudly. Goats usually only scream like that when something’s wrong. The idea is that the system will notify my dad right away so he can check on them.

The tricky part is that our goat pen is quite far from our house, around 30 meters (about 98 feet), so setting up communication for the system is a bit challenging. Using wires would be too complicated, and WiFi isn’t an option since we live in a rural area without access to cable internet.

So, my solution is to build a system that detects loud goat cries, and if it goes above a certain threshold, it’ll send an alert to the farmer using LoRa (Long Range). LoRa is a great fit because it works over long distances, doesn’t need internet, and is energy-efficient. With this system, my dad can quickly find out if something’s wrong in the pen, even if it’s far away.

How is it made? Check out the explanation below.
